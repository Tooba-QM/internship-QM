d: Mr. Christophe gave me a quick visit of the National Museum of Qatar which included the  Permanent exhibition galleries, Old Palace and  quick tour of NMoQ’s Temporary Exhibitions (Pipilotti Rist and Olafur Eliasson). After that I joined the Lusail Museum team weekly meeting where I got introduced to the whole team. Lastly, I got started with the visitors’ observations to try to understand our visitors/users. The observations were recorded in a structured manner, noting down specific actions, reactions, and notable behaviors of the visitors. By the end of these two days, I had filled almost 20 observation sheets. 
d1: After the observation, came taking surveys. These surveys were conducted at the end of visitors' museum tour in G12. I interacted with different types of people from all backgrounds and ages. These surveys were taken using Microsoft Forms and I was able to collect 18 responses from almost 40 people all together. After my day was completed, I attended the opening of the AI Digital Centre. It was wonderful to witness how NMoQ collaborated with Microsoft and have created this unique space for younger generation of Qatar to explore their talents and expand their interests in technology. 
d2: I did several activities during this day. I familiarized myself with the Python libraries 'pandas' and 'matplotlib' using Jupyter Notebook, these would help with the data analysis and visualization of the observations and surveys that I have collected. I created a GitHub page to post my weekly internship activities over there. Moreover, I visited the AI Digital Centre with Mr. Christophe and got to know more about what exactly the team will be doing there. Lastly, I was introduced to Mr. Martin Harvey, NMoQ’s Head of AV and Digital Support. He gave me an in-depth tour of the server rooms and how the technology behind the Art Films (that are displayed in NMOQ) works. During my visit to the server rooms, I observed the meticulous organization and cooling systems in place to ensure optimal performance and data security. As for the syncing and projector alignment challenges, it became evident that maintaining consistent synchronization between multiple devices and aligning projectors accurately could be complex tasks, requiring constant monitoring and fine-tuning to ensure seamless operation and visual clarity. This really broadened my horizon on how much work behind the scenes goes unnoticed people and only those directly involved in these tasks truly understand and appreciate the dedicated professionals who ensure smooth operations behind the scenes
description: My first week at the NMOQ for the internship was very welcoming and enjoyable. Each day I had something new to explore and this is summarised below:-
