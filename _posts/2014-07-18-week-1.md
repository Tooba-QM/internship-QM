d: After the observation, came taking surveys. These surveys were conducted at the end of visitors' museum tour in G12. I interacted with different types of people from all backgrounds and ages. These surveys were taken using Microsoft Forms and I was able to collect 18 responses from almost 40 people all together. After my day was completed, I attended the opening of the AI Digital Centre. It was wonderful to witness how NMoQ collaborated with Microsoft and have created this unique space for younger generation of Qatar to explore their talents and expand their interests in technology.

After that I joined the Lusail Museum team weekly meeting where I got introduced to the whole team. Lastly, I got started with the visitors’ observations to try to understand our visitors/users. The observations were recorded in a structured manner, noting down specific actions, reactions, and notable behaviors of the visitors. By the end of these two days, I had filled almost 20 observation sheets.
