d0: This week I had to experiment with museum APIs, so I researched existing projects and code repositories. I learned how to use Airtables to build free APIs. This is a powerful and versatile tool that allows users to create and manage databases in a user-friendly, spreadsheet-like interface. Having previously worked with APIs using MongoDB and Node.js, I found this approach to be novel and more straightforward in implementing the APIs. The ease and simplicity offered by Airtables presented a refreshing and efficient way to accomplish my API-related tasks.

d00: I took part in the Lusail Museum's team meeting, where we reviewed proposals for Expo 2023 Doha. This valuable experience granted me insight into the collaborative process of brainstorming ideas and engaging in discussions that lead to concrete solutions. Witnessing the transformation of ideas into reality was truly gratifying, knowing that some of these concepts would materialize in just a few months. Although my internship at the museum would soon come to an end, I felt fortunate to be involved in these discussions, as it allowed me to witness the fruition of the projects even after my departure. Among the various concepts discussed, one of them involved implementing a QR code poll for visitors during Expo 2023 Doha. For this particular concept, I was tasked with rapidly prototyping the response page for the QR code questions. During this process, I explored the capabilities of Microsoft Forms to determine its suitability for the task. However, I encountered a challenge with filtering out questions that asked for personal information like emails, as Microsoft Forms did not provide a direct solution. I conducted thorough research and discovered the potential of both Power BI and Power Automate. These tools proved to be invaluable in displaying real-time survey results while allowing customization of the displayed questions. To acquire the necessary skills, I turned to YouTube tutorials, immersing myself in the learning process of utilizing Power BI and Power Automate effectively. In the end, by utilizing Power BI and Power Automate, I effectively managed to exclude questions that sought personal information. 
d1: I had the privilege of attending a meeting with the organizer team at Doha Expo 2023, and it proved to be yet another wonderful experience. I am truly grateful to the Lusail team for providing me with this opportunity. Witnessing the behind-the-scenes processes and witnessing how the organizers were willing to collaborate with our team to implement our ideas was truly fascinating. During the meeting, I shared one of my ideas with the Lusail team, even though I was aware it might not be fully developed. The idea involved hosting a tree planting activity for the expo's visitors, with the intention of relocating these planted trees to Al Maha Island or a nearby location once the Lusail Museum construction was complete. I envisioned using social media to provide updates on the plantation progress and encourage people to visit the Ajyal Film Festival, creating a light-hearted and engaging introduction to our museum at the expo. I thought it would be a  cool and engaging way to connect with visitors and raise awareness about our museum at the expo. Following the meeting, I worked on creating a simple proof-of-concept response page using GitHub Pages, which incorporated the survey responses using powerbi and power automate and some additional information about the museum.

d2: I prepared a concise presentation on cybersecurity and also focused on integrating the API I had been working on earlier in the week into my audio guide. This task posed a bit of a challenge, as I had limited time for implementation.

c: In conclusion, the highlight of my week was grasping the importance of rapid prototyping and development for specific needs. This experience offered valuable insights into managing real-time situations and their challenges. As my internship comes to a close, I'm looking forward to making the most of the final weekðŸ˜Š.
