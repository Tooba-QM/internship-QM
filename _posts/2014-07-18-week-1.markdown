### My first week at the NMOQ for the internship was very welcoming and enjoyable. Each day I had something new to explore and this is summarised below:
DAY 1 AND 2: Mr. Christophe gave me a quick visit of the National Museum of Qatar which included the  Permanent exhibition galleries, Old Palace and  quick tour of NMoQ’s Temporary Exhibitions (Pipilotti Rist and Olafur Eliasson). After that I joined the Lusail Museum team weekly meeting where I got introduced to the whole team. Lastly, I got started with the visitors’ observations to try to understand our visitors/users. The observations were recorded in a structured manner, noting down specific actions, reactions, and notable behaviors of the visitors. By the end of these two days, I had filled almost 20 observation sheets.
