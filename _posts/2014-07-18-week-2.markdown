d0: During the second week, we welcomed a new intern to our team, and I participated in the weekly Lusail team meeting. My primary objective for the week was to duplicate the source code of the Australian Center for Moving Image in order to develop my own audio guide for a fictional exhibition. I took the time to familiarize myself with audio guides and conducted research on existing projects and code repositories related to this field.
d00: I enhanced the audio guide by implementing audio stops, which involved incorporating various forms of media such as images and captions in both English and Arabic. To streamline the process, I utilized the SharePoint repository specifically for exhibition materials. However, this task proved to be time-consuming as it required extracting audio from videos and separating them into English and Arabic versions. Nonetheless, I enjoyed working on this objective. Furthermore, to ensure consistency and adhere to the Lusail Museum's brand guidelines, I incorporated their official logo and utilized their specified hex colors throughout the design.
d1: On the third day, I made significant progress on improving the audio guide by introducing additional elements. Specifically, I focused on incorporating videos into one of the stops, which serves to provide users with a multi-modal experience by combining visual content with the audio explanations. Additionally, I explored the integration of a translate button that enables captions to switch between Arabic and English languages.

d3: I dedicated my time to making important updates to my weekly blog (such as created a section in my blog which could show my audio guide that I worked on this week) and intern passport. Lastly, I build QR codes using https://qrfy.com/ leading directly to each of the stop in the audio guide (Scan the QR codes below to see the stops).
