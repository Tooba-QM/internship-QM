d0: I had the opportunity to explore the 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum (QOSM) with Mr. Christophe and Amamah. Mr. Christophe gave us a comprehensive tour of all seven galleries housing objects from around the globe, from the origins of sports to the present day. The multimedia used there like huge vertical interactive screen felt more interactive compared to the small interactive table found in NMOQ. The overall lighting at the museum was also much better compared to NMOQ (where certain areas are quite dim). One of the most impressive features was the immersive video in one of the galleries. The combination of four screens created a stunning 3D effect that left me in awe. However, the highlight of the visit was undoubtedly the last gallery, known as the Activation Zone. Its purpose was to promote physical activity throughout Qatar and encourage a healthy and active lifestyle. The implementation of the RFID system, which tracked our activities through interactive games and generated individual reports on physical literacy at the end of the tour, was unlike anything I had seen in a museum before. It was an immensely enjoyable and exciting experience, somewhat reminiscent of the LENS technology at ACMI. In my opinion, other museums in Qatar should consider incorporating similar technologies to enhance visitor engagement. Overall, I would like to thank Mr. Christophe for taking out his time and showing us around the museum. As a first-time visitor, I was genuinely captivated by the experience, exceeding my initial expectations. I am eagerly looking forward to revisiting the museum with my friends and family and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an enjoyable visit.

d00: I explored the provided links and repositories, gaining knowledge about the open access policies and initiatives of diverse museums and cultural institutions. Additionally, I delved into articles that focused on visualizing artist connections using Gephi, further expanding my understanding of innovative data visualization techniques.
d1: Today, I searched for datasets containing information about artists from various museums that can be utilized to create visual representations on a map. Furthermore, I familiarized myself with Gephi (a powerful tool for network visualization and analysis) by watching tutorials on youtube. To solidify my understanding, I actively engaged in a practical exercise where I worked with an example dataset showcasing a citation network. Through this exercise, I had the opportunity to apply the learned techniques and visualize the citation network using Gephi. Additionally, I performed thorough analysis and statistics on the network, enabling me to gain deeper insights into its structure, connectivity patterns, and important nodes or clusters within the network. (Below you can find a clip of navigating between nodes in Gephi)
