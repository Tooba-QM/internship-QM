d0: I had the opportunity to explore the 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum (QOSM) with Mr. Christophe and Amamah. Mr. Christophe gave us a comprehensive tour of all seven galleries housing objects from around the globe, from the origins of sports to the present day. The multimedia used there like huge vertical interactive screen felt more interactive compared to the small interactive table found in NMOQ. The overall lighting at the museum was also much better compared to NMOQ (where certain areas are quite dim). One of the most impressive features was the immersive video in one of the galleries. The combination of four screens created a stunning 3D effect that left me in awe. However, the highlight of the visit was undoubtedly the last gallery, known as the Activation Zone. Its purpose was to promote physical activity throughout Qatar and encourage a healthy and active lifestyle. The implementation of the RFID system, which tracked our activities through interactive games and generated individual reports on physical literacy at the end of the tour, was unlike anything I had seen in a museum before. It was an immensely enjoyable and exciting experience, somewhat reminiscent of the LENS technology at ACMI. In my opinion, other museums in Qatar should consider incorporating similar technologies to enhance visitor engagement. Overall, I would like to thank Mr. Christophe for taking out his time and showing us around the museum. As a first-time visitor, I was genuinely captivated by the experience, exceeding my initial expectations. I am eagerly looking forward to revisiting the museum with my friends and family and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an enjoyable visit.
