d0: I had the opportunity to explore the 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum (QOSM) with Mr. Christophe and Amamah. Mr. Christophe gave us a comprehensive tour of all seven galleries housing objects from around the globe, from the origins of sports to the present day. The multimedia used there like huge vertical interactive screen felt more interactive compared to the small interactive table found in NMOQ. The overall lighting at the museum was also much better compared to NMOQ (where certain areas are quite dim). One of the most impressive features was the immersive video in one of the galleries. The combination of four screens created a stunning 3D effect that left me in awe. However, the highlight of the visit was undoubtedly the last gallery, known as the Activation Zone. Its purpose was to promote physical activity throughout Qatar and encourage a healthy and active lifestyle. The implementation of the RFID system, which tracked our activities through interactive games and generated individual reports on physical literacy at the end of the tour, was unlike anything I had seen in a museum before. It was an immensely enjoyable and exciting experience, somewhat reminiscent of the LENS technology at ACMI. In my opinion, other museums in Qatar should consider incorporating similar technologies to enhance visitor engagement. Overall, I would like to thank Mr. Christophe for taking out his time and showing us around the museum. As a first-time visitor, I was genuinely captivated by the experience, exceeding my initial expectations. I am eagerly looking forward to revisiting the museum with my friends and family and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking an enjoyable visit.

d00: This week my main task was to visualise on a map where the artists featured in a museum’s collection are from? and how it compares to the artists included in another museum’s collection. So I explored the provided links (videos and articles) and repositories, gaining knowledge about the open access policies and initiatives of diverse museums and cultural institutions. Additionally, I delved into articles that focused on visualizing artist connections using Gephi, further expanding my understanding of innovative data visualization techniques.
d1: Today, I searched for datasets containing information about artists from various museums that can be utilized to create visual representations on a map. Furthermore, I familiarized myself with Gephi (a powerful tool for network visualization and analysis) by watching tutorials on youtube. To solidify my understanding, I worked with an example dataset that was provided in one of them youtube tutorials. This dataset was divided into two csv files, nodes and edges. The example dataset demonstrated a citation network, which is a network of connections formed by citations between academic research papers. Scholars often cite previous works to support their arguments and build upon existing research. Through this exercise, I had the opportunity to apply the learned techniques and visualize the citation network using Gephi.  Additionally, I performed thorough analysis and statistics on the network, enabling me to gain deeper insights into its structure, connectivity patterns, and important nodes or clusters within the network. The final visualisation is shown under screenshots. (Below you can find a clip of navigating between nodes in Gephi)

caption: The singular nodes were filtered as they were authors who had cited others work but had no connection with other authors. The main network I was left with had two clusters one on the right (people who studied small world networks and its mathematics) and other on the left (people who studied the sociology of networks). The network was then filtered using the node size and colors based on its attributes. The nodes that are orange in color have a higher degree of closeness and high betweeness, meaning it has the most connections with other nodes. In this case, this author was cited by almost all other authors in their work. This node was removed since it did not provide anything new to the network.
d44: On my last day of the week,  I focused on cleaning the datasets obtained from museum archives. This process took longer since I was not familiar with it. Additionally, in order to create clear visualizations on Gephi, I had to generate separate CSV files for nodes and edges. The node file included the artist's name, which served as the label for the node, along with additional information like their nationality. The edge file, on the other hand, represented connections between artists based on their shared nationality. These edges were utilized to link nodes of artists from the same nationality. Upon loading these files into Gephi, I encountered some difficulties navigating through the filters and eliminating unnecessary nodes. Nevertheless, in the end, I managed to make some sense of it.

c: Currently, I have solely focused on artists from a single museum. However, in the upcoming week, my plan is to merge two museums and establish comparisons between them. On the whole, I found the experience of working on something distinct this week quite enjoyable. I am pleased that each week brings me fresh tasks to tackle. Over the past month, I have gained a substantial amount of knowledge and learning.
